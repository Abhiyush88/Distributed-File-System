# Distributed-File-System
Develop an application layer protocol which provides distributed version control functionality among 3 nodes including an android device, a Windows desktop and an Amazon S3 server


Project Description:
---------------------
1) A file directory structure is maintained at all the 3 nodes, cloud, android and laptop. 
2) If a file is to be added or modified on any of the 3 nodes, clicking the 'Sync' button syncs files on all the 3 nodes by comparing the checksum and timestamp of the file to be added or modified.
